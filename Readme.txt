Rotten Tomatoes SPA

This is an little implementation of Rotten Tomatoes.
The following external libraries are used
Durandal
Knockout
Jquery
RottenTomatoesApi. I used this just because was available. I would like to do my own implementation since some things maybe do not work quite well.

3 Projects
RottenTomatoes website
RottenTomatoes.Common: Wrapper for RottenTomatoesApi
RottenTomatoes.Data : Model and enumeration

Interesting things.
This is the first time that I worked with Durandal and Knockout.
Do you know that if you return from a function does not bind very well in knockout. I used a viewmodel variable for the search for that reason.

TODO: (Because I found it very interesting)
Add a better look and feel implementation of the tables.
